# `go-itertools`

Library providing functions for working with Go 1.23 sequences and iterators.
Inspired by some built-in Python functions like
[`chain`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chain) and
[`zip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) and the Python
[`itertools` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html).
